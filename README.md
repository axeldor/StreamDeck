# StreamDeck

Hi, here a fork project from David Madison.
Full details : @link partsnotincluded.com/electronics/diy-stream-deck-mini-macro-keyboard

A arduino Pro Micro is required (with ATmega32U4 on board).

I added a oled screen and support leds inside. LEDs are triggered by a non touch button (TTP223 button) with 6 light modes.
